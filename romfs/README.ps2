# ROMFS : - ROM File System
#--------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#
# So what is it ? Basically, ROMFS allows to emulate a directory, 
# that directory being an binary image in memory. It allows to embed 
# files and external resources directly in the ELF, while keeping the 
# original i/o routines to access them..
# 
# The initial project has been started by Jakub Jelinek on linux, 
# then gawd reused it for flashback, and this is how I discovered it. 
# Drakonite also participated in adding functionality, and since the 
# stuff is starting to be relatively mature (IMHO), it's time to share it ! 
#   
# You'll find in the regress directory a good example on how to use it, 
# but it just consist on globally respecting the following steps :
#    - include makefile.romfs into your makefile (Adapting path(s),...)
#    - include <romfs_io.h> in your project
#    - call rioInit() from your main
# 
# All calls to fopen, fread, etc.. Are replaced by calls to ropen, rread... 
# Thanks to the defines in the makefile (...)
# 
# And you're done !
