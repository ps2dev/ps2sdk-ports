The following patchs has been applied to the headers files:

--- jpeglib.h: Add extern "C" {} if __cplusplus is defined.

This should be harmless.

--- jconfig.h: Remove unused symbol HAVE_STDDEF_H and HAVE_STDLIB_H since
they are not used by the installed headers files and cause problem with
autoconf.

This can theoretically cause problems if your software relies on theses symbols
being defined by this header. If it ever happens, please define them manually.

Note: this is not Debian-specific, others distributions apply similar patches.

Thanks for using Debian!
