 Lua 5.1.1 - PS2 Port
---------------------

 This is a version of LUA 5.1 for PlayStation2, using the ps2sdk.

--------------------
 Build Instructions
--------------------

  ## Configure and build the library.
  make all

  ## Install the library
  make install


--------------------
 Notes
--------------------

 -) lua_Numbers are floats here, not doubles. (so mathlibf.c replaces mathlib.c)
    This is because the ps2 is terribly slow with doubles since its cop1 is 
    only handling floats. Hence, you can't compile a lua source code on PC side 
    with a common lua compiler. You need a PC-side lua compiler which uses floats 
    instead of doubles. That, or compiling using your PS2.

 -) the lua's mathlibf is using newlib's math library, which means you need
    to add -lm if you plan to use it.
    
 -) the lua's mathlib is actually using doubles math functions, which means
    slowness. I've included a mathlibf that uses the float counterparts. That
    is, you have to use luaopen_mathf instead of luaopen_math, and everything
    should be okay.
 
 -) Several missing functions have been stubbed, you can find them in the 
    ps2_stub.c file.
