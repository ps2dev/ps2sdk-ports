PS2SDL CHANGELOG
-------------
17 Mar 2024 Wolf3s
	* Now PS2SDL supports by standard keyboard(mouse is not working yet)

14 Mar 2024 Wolf3s
	* Update to SDL 1.2.15

29 Apr 2006 gawd
	* Added force_signal hack, to lock on NTSC/PAL (good for debugging)
	* Added 288x224 resolution
	* Support for gsKit 0.3 'immediate' mode

17 Feb 2006 Drakonite
	* Multitap support should now be considered fully operational
	* Multitap enabled SDL compatible with ps2link 1.41 and newer,
	  even from memcard
	* If multitap support is enabled, thus requiring XSIO2MAN, SDL
	  will now detect if SIO2MAN has been loaded and if so will
	  reboot the iop. This fixes loading from loaders while not
	  breaking PS2LINK 1.41 and higher support.
	* SDL_video now correctly allocs a buffer for display texture

17 Jan 2006 Drakonite
	* Added multitap support to SDL_Joystick
	* Bug: Using XSIO2MAN/XPADMAN for mtap support breaks 
	  compatability with early PS2s. No fix. It's either early units 
	  or mtap, can't support both.
	* Bug: Issues may arise when a multitap is used in first 
	  controller slot
	* Bug: Using XSIOMAN currently breaks loading if using ps2link 
	  from memcard.

11 Sep 2005 gawd
	* fixed SDL_Joystick's wait_pad routine
	* SDL_Joystick now turns on ANALOG if available
