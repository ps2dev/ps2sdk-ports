PS2SDK Port of libtiff
==========================================

This is the libtiff port to PS2SDK!

Use TIFFReadPS2Image to get a texture converted+prepared to be sent to
VRAM and used as a texture.

You should set the LIBTIFF environment variable to the path where you have
extracted libtiff. (and this readme file!)

gsKit 0.3 supports TIFF textures via this port. The gsKit_texture_tiff
routine in ee/gs/gsTexture.c shows a simple use case for this library on PS2.
You can test in alpha sample from gsKit.

Notes:
-----
JPEG, Pixar, and NeXT compression are disabled!

Current release uses doubles... this is extremely crappy and
slow so please don't use this for anything performance sensitive.

CXX library support disabled. (It's slow/bloated enough as is ffs!)

Note: I do some hard "orientation" flipping manually before you get
the bytes from me when doing TIFF->RGBA conversion.

So by default, the orientation will be correct for the PS2's texture format.
If you fiddle with orientations yourself, remember they will be mirrored
on the Y axis as a result!

Also, I am scaling the alpha component from 0x00-0xFF to 0x00-0x80.

(This is required since on PS2 0x80 is 1.0f)

If you do not desire that, you can use TIFFReadRGBAImage or the like.

Changes with original sources:
- tif_ps2.c - completely new file
- tif_dirinfo.c - lfind changed to bsearch
- tif_getimage.c, tiffio.h - added new function (TIFFReadPS2Image):


Enjoy!
